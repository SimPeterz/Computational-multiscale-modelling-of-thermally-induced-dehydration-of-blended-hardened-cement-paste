% A slightly different code was used in the paper. Especially for the      %
% homogenisation part. As long as the volume fraction of AFm in the cement %
% paste is not too high, a simple RVE with a hydrate matrix in which the   %
% capillary porosity is embedded as spheres can be used. A more complex    %
% homogenization part will be published in the future.                     %
